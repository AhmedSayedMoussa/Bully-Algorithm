# Bully-Algorithm

## Bully Algorithm 
Is a method for dynamically electing a coordinator or leader from a group of distributed computer processes. The process with the highest process ID number from amongst the non-failed processes is selected as the coordinator.

You can read more about it through the following link https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bully_algorithm.

## How to run the Task?
This application has been created using C# Windows Forms and .NET 6 framework.
You can run the code using visual studio and just hit run. Or you can open the following form which exists in the following link https://github.com/AhmedSayedMoussa/Bully-Algorithm/tree/main/PipesClient/bin/Debug/net6.0-windows/PipesClient.exe and there is an appsettings file in the same directory you can change any constant variables such as the message texts, the time intervals and so on.

You can open more than form and each one will be instantiated with a new process Id in order to test the program and make sure that it’s working as expected.

If you encounter anything, don’t hesitate to call me :))
